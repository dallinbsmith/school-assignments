           <h2>Justin Bieber banned from China in order to 'purify' nation</h2>
              <p>Canadian pipsqueak Justin Bieber may have successfully turned around his reputation by staying out of the headlines and converting millions of cynical pop fans by releasing uncomfortably decent music, but his good behaviour tour hasn't yet worked on the Chinese government, who have banned the star from performing in the country.</p>

            <img src ="https://alfred310.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/bieber-big.jpg">
             
              <p> When a Chinese Bieber fan contacted the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture to ask why her idol hasn't been seen in the country for several years, despite scheduling dates in nearby Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and the Philippines on the Asian leg of his latest world tour, they were met with a friendly if firm response.</p>    
                
              <p>"Justin Bieber is a gifted singer, but he is also a controversial young foreign singer," the bureau told the fan in a statement. "In order to maintain order in the Chinese market and purify the Chinese performance environment, it is not suitable to bring in badly behaved entertainers.</p>
                
              <p class = "biebs">"We hope that as Justin Bieber matures, he can continue to improve his own words and actions, and truly become a singer beloved by the public."</p>
                
              <p>Bieber's bad behaviour in the USA, which included an arrest for drunk driving and a strange incident in which he urinated in a janitor's bucket and yelled "F--- Bill Clinton!" at a portrait of the former president, didn't result in much diplomatic intervention, but his offensive behaviour during his last Chinese tour created national outrage in the country.</p>

              <p>Along with being carried up the Great Wall of China by his bodyguards (an image of which resulted in a bombardment of international mockery), Bieber was also filmed skateboarding through the streets of Beijing while being pursued by his entourage.</p>
                
                <p>Bieber joins fellow music acts including Oasis and Lady Gaga in being banned from touring in the country for being "unsuitable".</p>

                <p>Gaga has in fact been banned twice from the nation. Her music was placed on a government blacklist in 2011 for its "vulgar lyrics", before the ban was lifted in 2014. Unfortunately, her ban was reinstated less than two years later, reportedly after she controversially met with the Dalai Lama.</p>
                
       <h2>'Nobody kill anybody': Murder-free weekend urged in Baltimore</h2>
          
               <p>A 44-year-old mother might seem an unusual visitor on the drug corners of Baltimore, but Erricka Bridgeford has shown up for weeks to make her pitch for peace.

              <p>Forget your grudges for one weekend, she urges the young men she finds. Help bring a 72-hour truce to a city besieged by gun violence.</p>

              <p>“It’s a citywide call,” she tells them, “but I’m talking to you.”</p>
              

              <p>Bridgeford and other neighborhood leaders are drumming up support for a three-day ceasefire the first weekend of August to quell Baltimore’s violence. She admits that such peace is a tall order for a city that’s seen 188 killings this year.</p>

              <p>Organizers aim to stop the shooting from Friday, Aug. 4, through Sunday, Aug. 6, with a unified and blunt message: <span>“Nobody kill anybody.”</span></p>

              <p>Their message has been printed on T-shirts and flyers. They designed a website and held community meetings. More than 1,600 people visited their Facebook page. The grass-roots campaign has swelled since it began in May.</p>

              <p>“I’ve seen the momentum build over the past several weeks,” said T.J. Smith, spokesman for Baltimore police. “We are all in this together, and we’re 1,000 percent supportive of the efforts.”</p>

              <p>The campaign urges people to put aside their guns and join weekend events for healing, from a peace rally Friday evening to a vigil Sunday where participants will read the names of every person killed in 2017.</p>

              <p>“The Baltimore Ceasefire was not declared by any one organization,” organizers wrote on their website. “This ceasefire is the product of Baltimore residents not only being exhausted by homicides, but believing that Baltimore can have a murder-free weekend if everyone takes responsibility.”</p>

              <p>More than 600 people have pledged to keep the peace, they wrote. Among them are some of the young men Bridgeford has met on the corners.</p>
                
             
              <p>“You just talk to them like they’re your little brother,” she said.</p>

              <p>A professional mediator, neighborhood volunteer and part-time Uber driver — “Everyone who gets in my car leaves with a flyer and a speech” — Bridgeford says her younger brother was gunned down a decade ago in Southwest Baltimore. His killer was never caught.</p>

              <p>Next month’s ceasefire would prove successful if it deters a single shooting, she said. And she figures the movement has already saved a life somewhere.</p>

              <p>“Somebody was plotting on this weekend,” she said. “Now they’re not going to do it because of a rumbling in their soul.”</p>

              <p>The organizers are raising money through their website for more flyers. Some of the money will be donated to the families of anyone killed over the ceasefire weekend. Bridgeford is urging everyone she meets to echo the call for peace.</p>

              <p><span>“Jumping out in open-air drug markets might not be for everyone,”</span> she said. “But we’re asking everyone to do their part.”</p>

              <p>Community ceasefires, however, have failed to stem the violence in the past. The group Mothers of Murdered Sons called for a ceasefire over Mother’s Day weekend, but at least four people were shot, including a 59-year-old man and 17-year-old woman. Both were killed.</p>

            <p>Other communities have called for ceasefires after spates of violence in Birmingham, Ala., and Berkeley, Calif. Such efforts are as much about empowering residents as reducing homicide statistics, said Cassandra Crifasi, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins-Baltimore Collaborative for Violence Reduction.</p>
