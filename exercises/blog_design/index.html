            <h2>the day the music died.</h2>
            <h4 class="date">Published: Whenever. 2017</h4>
            <h4 class="post">In December of 2014 I decided I was finally going to do something about it.

                <p>There are so many different prescription drugs on the market, and they‚Äôre either insanely expensive or have weird side effects like possible liver damage or not being able to taste anything.</p>

                <p>I decided I would try a more natural approach. There are about a million different nail fungus home remedies out there, and I spent hours reading about them. I wanted to know which one was worth investing months of my time. I didn‚Äôt want to have to experiment.</p>

                <p>Well I couldn‚Äôt find the answer. There are a lot of articles that offer advice and you wonder whether the people who wrote them even had nail fungus. Sometimes you will read the comments section on these pages and see an idea that looks promising, but there‚Äôs no follow up (did it actually work or what?). What you will not find much of is someone saying, ‚ÄúI cured my nail fungus and this is exactly what I did.‚Äù</p>

                <p>There aren‚Äôt many people who have actually described the process, took pictures and recorded results over the long period of time that it takes to get rid of nail fungus.</p>

                <p>So I decided I would make this site. I don‚Äôt care who sees pictures of my ugly toenails! ü§ì After much research I made a decision. My home remedy for nail fungus is a combination of three different things.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Tea tree oil</strong></p>

                <p>Scientific studies have proven its antifungal properties in vitro, and it is a well-known home remedy for toenail fungus.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Coconut oil</strong></p>

                <p>This is a carrier oil is which reduces the risk of getting a rash from the tea tree oil, which can be harsh if used undiluted. It has also been shown to have antifungal properties as well.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Urea cream</strong></p>

                <p>This softens the crumbly crud that accumulates under the nail. My theory was that it would enhance the absorption and efficacy of the tea tree oil. When I started, I used a product called Kerasal Nail (active ingredient = urea), but I have since switched to 40% urea cream. It‚Äôs much more economical to buy it this way.</p>

                <p>This worked amazingly well, and you can look at the diary and see what great progress I made in the first weeks and months. However, I grew impatient and thought that maybe there was a ‚Äòperfect‚Äô formula yet to be discovered. I experimented with replacing tea tree oil with other things (oregano oil, terbinafine cream, thyme oil). I wasted about a year floundering around, and then I went back to my original and best remedy.</p>

                <p>Nothing else I have tried has worked like tea tree oil.</p>

                <p>Today my toenails look great. I never thought I would be rid of this. They aren‚Äôt thick and yellow anymore, and are nearly completely grown out.</p>
