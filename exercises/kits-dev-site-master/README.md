## Welcome to my developer portfolio!

If any of this is helpful to your own site, tinker away - go nuts!

## Getting started

1) npm/yarn install
2) npm/yarn start

It is built, so if you want to host any changes you'll need to run npm build. This site is hosted with Surge. To host your own:

``` 
npm install -g surge
```
cd into your root folder:
```
npm run build
cd build
surge
```
